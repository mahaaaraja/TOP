                This is a traditional Indian bread filled with a well seasoned boiled potato studding that is very popular for every age group. It's a heavenly dish to serve on a rainy day. It's an easy recipe and a definite group pleaser. Garnish each paratha with a thin slice of butter and serve with plain yogurt.

                Who doesn't like pasta? Who doesn't like cheese?
                Everyone likes these two right, but what if they are combined?
                Magic happens and a dish is born that just causes a symphony of flavours in your mouth.
                Minimal ingridients, easy to make, takes less time, the added veggies make it nutritious, tastes fabulous, now what else do you need?
